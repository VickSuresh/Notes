# Notes
## Frontend for a notes web app. 
Built in Typescript using React and Next, with MaterialUI v5.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/VickSuresh/Notes.git`.
2. The Notes-be backend **must** be cloned and running on your local machine for the app to work.
3. Inside `./config/config.ts`, the endpoint of the API is located, and by default set to localhost:8080. If you made a change to the port in your .env of the backend, you must change this port value here as well. The endpoints have to be the same.
4. Build the project with `npm run build`. 
5. Start the server with `npm run start`.
6. Connect to the app in your browser by navigating to localhost:3000.
